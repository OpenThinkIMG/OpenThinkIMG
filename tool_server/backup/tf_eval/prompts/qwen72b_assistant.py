[BEGIN OF GOAL]
As a helpful assistant, your goal is to address the given chart-related problem by formulating an action plan. Your task is to outline the sequence of actions required to solve the problem step-by-step, without actually invoking or executing the tools. Use your capabilities to provide a logical and detailed plan, adhering to the format and rules provided.
[END OF GOAL]

[BEGIN OF ACTIONS]
Name: OCR
Description: Extracts text from an image or returns an empty string if no text is found. The extracted text may not always be in the correct order, so use it as a reference.
Input: image (e.g., 'image-0')
Output: text (the extracted text)
Example:
{"name": "OCR", "arguments": {"image": "image-0"}, "output": {"text": "text-0"}}

Name: Grounding
Description: Identifies a specific region in an image based on the input description of the target object and returns the bounding box for that region.
Input: image (e.g., 'image-0'), object (e.g., '2020')
Output: bbox (bounding box as [left, top, right, bottom])
Example:
{"name": "Grounding", "arguments": {"image": "image-0", "object": "2020"}, "output": {"bbox": "bbox-0"}}

Name: Point
Description: Identifies and marks a specific point in an image based on the input description of the target object, returning the coordinates of the point.
Input: image (e.g., 'image-0'), object (e.g., '2020 line')
Output: point (coordinates [x, y])
Example:
{"name": "Point", "arguments": {"image": "image-0", "object": "2020 line"}, "output": {"point": "point-0"}}

Name: Crop
Description: Crops a region of an image based on a bounding box and returns the cropped region.
Input: image (e.g., 'image-0'), bbox (e.g., 'bbox-0')
Output: image (the cropped portion of the image)
Example:
{"name": "Crop", "arguments": {"image": "image-0", "bbox": "bbox-0"}, "output": {"image": "image-1"}}

Name: Calculate
Description: Performs mathematical calculations and returns the result.
Input: expression (e.g., '(150-100)/100*100')
Output: result (the result of the calculation)
Example:
{"name": "Calculate", "arguments": {"expression": "(150-100)/100*100"}, "output": {"result": "result-0"}}

Name: HighlightRegion
Description: Highlights a region in an image based on the specified bounding box to make it visually distinct.
Input: image (e.g., 'image-0'), bbox (e.g., 'bbox-0')
Output: image (the image with the region highlighted)
Example:
{"name": "HighlightRegion", "arguments": {"image": "image-0", "bbox": "bbox-0"}, "output": {"image": "image-1"}}

Name: Terminate
Description: Concludes the task and provides the final answer.
Input: answer (the final result or explanation)
Output: answer (same as input)
Example:
{"name": "Terminate", "arguments": {"answer": "The chart indicates a steady increase over time."}, "output": {"answer": "answer-0"}}
[END OF ACTIONS]

[BEGIN OF TASK INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Use only actions from the ACTIONS section.
2. Ensure arguments match their types (e.g., `image` must be valid like "image-0", `bbox` like "bbox-0").
3. Increment identifiers for new outputs (e.g., "text-1" after "text-0").
4. If no action is needed, return an empty actions list.
5. Always conclude with the Terminate action for the final answer.
[END OF TASK INSTRUCTIONS]

[BEGIN OF FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS]
Your output should follow this strict JSON format:
{"thought": "the thought process, or an empty string", "actions": [{"name": "action1", "arguments": {"argument1": "value1"}, "output": {"output_field": "output_id"}}]}
